I came up with the idea of Discovery Day when I experienced Artsfest my freshman year, and thought it would be awesome to have a similar outreach program for STEM fields.  I grew up going to math museums, hearing about protein research, and staying updated on computer science developments.  So naturally, I knew there were applications of the biology, the chemistry, the calculus we were learning in school.  I wanted to share my knowledge, and provide a different way for students to learn more.  I started Lab’s first STEM club with the mission of Discovery Day: a day about interdisciplinary and applicable STEM.


Part of Discovery day is to expose people to the applications of what they are learning in class to real-world research.  Another part of Discovery Day is focused on people who would rather take an english elective or history elective than another math class.  STEM relates to their topics of interest as well!  From global warming issues discussed in congress, to how water shortage affects California’s government, budget, and infrastructure, to statistical analysis of business strategies, STEM, the humanities, and social sciences are all interconnected and relevant to our daily lives.


The first Discovery Day was in April of 2016, with the format of workshops in classrooms throughout the day, in addition to the Discovery Day speaker, Dr. Thomas Gajewski, who talked about immunology as a cure to cancer at the assembly. 


This year, we (STEM Discovery Club) has bigger and better aspirations of having workshops in 40 different classrooms throughout the high school, in addition to inviting a scientist from NASA”s Jet Propulsion Laboratory!  Discovery Day is on **Thursday November 10th**, we hope you have fun and learn something new!
