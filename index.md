Welcome to the University of Chicago Laboratory School’s STEM Discovery Club webpage!

Our mission is to enable every student to understand and learn more about the STEM fields -- ideas and applications beyond class -- and how they relate to the humanities, art, and social sciences.​ For as much as a scientist can appreciate art, we hope to show that you don’t need to master calculus or astrophysics to appreciate STEM in everyday life.

The first Discovery Day was in April of 2016, with the format of workshops in classrooms throughout the day, in addition to the Discovery Day speaker, Dr. Thomas Gajewski, who talked about immunology as a cure to cancer at the assembly.

This year, we (STEM Discovery Club) has bigger and better aspirations of having workshops in 40 different classrooms throughout the high school, in addition to inviting a scientist from NASA”s Jet Propulsion Laboratory! Discovery Day is on Thursday November 10th, we hope you have fun and learn something new!
