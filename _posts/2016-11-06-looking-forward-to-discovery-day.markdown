Hello Everyone!
 
We are very excited for Lab’s second Discovery Day.  Discovery Day is about understanding how STEM is integrated into our daily lives.  From the programming in Photoshop to predicting the next president, STEM’s applications in other fields create new lenses through which we view the world.
 
Students will attend their usual classes, in addition to the Discovery Day Assembly, where we will hear from Dr. Steve Chien, a NASA and Caltech scientist, talk about monitoring volcanoes, studying the comet Rosetta, and remote controlled ocean robots.
 
We have been working really hard to organize this, and hope you all find the workshops fun and engaging!
